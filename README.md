#HW hello rails

## Summary

In this assignment I created a Rails app from scratch: a simple app called RottenPotatoes (inspired by the real web site RottenTomatoes) for cataloging movies. RottenPotatoes lets users interactively (via a Web browser) create database entries for new movies, view or modify the content of movie records (movie title, rating, description, and so on), and delete movie records. I deployed the app on the public cloud.

## Learning Goals
After this assignment, I am be able to:

Create a new Rails app from scratch, including making necessary adjustments to the Gemfile (specifying which libraries the app relies on) and immediately placing the app under version control so you can keep track of changes

Set up a database to store the Rails models, by writing and executing an initial migration describing the database's schema

Create a basic set of controller actions and views to support the CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete) on a resource in a Rails app, and specify HTTP routes that map to the controller actions

Run and interact with the app in your development environment, including using the debugger to interactively track down bugs and inspect application state, such as the parameters supplied to a controller action

Deploy the app to the public cloud, in this case using Heroku's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) facility
